# Hi I am JennyO👋

I am a student at MidUniversity in Sweden. I study webdevelopment. Before I started studying I was working as a controller at one of the largest hospitals in Sweden. I loved my job. But as the opportunity arose to move to Africa, Liberia, we took a chance and relocated the family and we are now living in Monrovia, Liberia🇱🇷since 1,5 years. 
I got bored at life as an at home mom already after a couple of weeks so I started to study arts and Georgian language. But then I stumbled across the webdevelopment program at [Miun](https://www.miun.se/webbutveckling).
I thought;

> I know nothing about this, absolutely nothing - I better try it out!

It is challenging, in the beginning I would not have survived without google, I googled __EVERYTHING__; 
* What is a Terminal 🙀 
* How do I code❓
* How may programming languages are there🤔 
* Is Javascript impossible to learn? 🤯etc.

I truly believe I am the person at the program with the least background knowledge. I am 42 years old, older than many other students, some say that they did some programming in high school. When I was in highschool, we had one computer hall at the school, we used it 2 hours per week, mainly for typing. Now my son, who is five years old has his own computer for Kindergarten.. Different times, lovely times. It is pretty cool to be able to impress the kids with the things we create at the programme.  
  
So, this Github account started for me to save versions of the work I am doing and to be able to share files and repositories. It seems to be a great place to be.
